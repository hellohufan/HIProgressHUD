/**
 * Displays a simple HUD window containing a progress indicator and two optional labels for short messages.
 *
 * This is a simple drop-in class for displaying a progress HUD view similar to Apple's private UIProgressHUD class.
 * The MBProgressHUD window spans over the entire space given to it by the initWithFrame: constructor and catches all
 * user input on this region, thereby preventing the user operations on components below the view.
 *
 * @note To still allow touches to pass through the HUD, you can set hud.userInteractionEnabled = NO.
 * @attention MBProgressHUD is a UI class and should therefore only be accessed on the main thread.
